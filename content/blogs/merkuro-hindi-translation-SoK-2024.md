In this blog, I will discuss my experience with season of KDE 2024. 

I came to know about this program through a youtube video. I was given some pre tasks to complete by the mentors of the project which can be found at https://github.com/officialasishkumar/translation-kde-applications. 

After completing the pre-tasks, I applied for the project and eventually got selected. 

The first task was to translate [Merkuro](https://apps.kde.org/merkuro.calendar/) in Hindi. 
I used a software by kde called [Lokalize](https://apps.kde.org/lokalize/) to translate the application. If you wish to get started using Lokalize, you can read this [blog](https://raghukamath.com/how-to-translate-krita-to-your-own-language/) by Raghu Kamath.
